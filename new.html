        <h1><strong><em>ZELDA</em></strong></h1>
        <p>The legend of zelda is a great game.MY personal favorite is The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask.It's the sequel to the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time.</p>
        <p>Im hesistant to buy a desktop pc because my house is a little cramped, and you need to consider the electricity bill to.I kinda hesitant to buy a laptop too because the specs is shit compared to desktop.The good thing is the portability tho.I know the steam Deck existence too.The problem is the availability of that thing.It's like a shiny pokemon or a secret dialogue of a npc when you talk to them multiple times.that's how hard to get a steam Deck</p>
